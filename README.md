# organigram

The original organigram was a diagram drawn by an Italian mid-level gangster showing how various tomb robbers, middle men, dealers, and museum people were organized in Italy in various ‘cordata’ (Italian for how mountain climbers are tied together as they ascend). The new ‘organigram’ generates automatic knowledge graphs from newspaper articles, auction catalogues, the Panama Papers, and other public sources which will enable us to predict relationships that should exist and are otherwise hidden. This project is with Donna Yates, who is an Associate Professor in the department of Criminal Law and Criminology at Maastricht University. This project is funded by a SSHRC Insight Development Grant. Current RAs on the project are Chantal Brousseau, Jonah Ellens, and Callum McDermott.
