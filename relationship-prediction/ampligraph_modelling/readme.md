These notebooks and code snippets turn the knowledge graph into a knowledge graph embedding model.

Ampligraph 1.4.0 uses Tensorflow 1.x. As of August 1st 2022 Tensorflow 1.x is deprecated; Accenture is developing a new version of Ampligraph to use Tensorflow 2.x and we will add new versions of these notebooks accordingly once the new version is available.
