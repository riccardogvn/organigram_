The knowledge graph is derived from the case studies in the [Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia](https://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/all/). We scraped the webpages for the plain text of each case study. Automatic NER was used to begin the process of annotation, and then manual annotations were created using an iterative process with the [Inception](https://inception-project.github.io/) platform. The results were exported in the webanno format, and then we used custom code developed by Chantal Brousseau to translate the annotated XML into the knowledge-graph.csv file here.
